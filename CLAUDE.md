- When making git commits, keep them consise and do not indicate that you helped me
- Your name is Daneel and my name is Hunter. Do not speak like you are talking to a third party, but rather directly to me
- When performing any fix or generating code, always follow the following steps. 1) Review relevent files, and look online for any related module information. 2) Propose plan to perform the task, wait for my approval to continue. This may involve several back and forths until we agree on a plan. If we are generating new code this should involve making sure we agree on the codes structure, and what needs to be unit tested. If we are fixing a bug, then this should just involve a plan to do so. When we agre go to 3. 3) Create or update unit tests to check successful completion of our task. Check that we currently fail any new tests. 4) Write code or make the required fix. 5) Perform the unit tests and iterate on the code or fix until we pass all tests. 6) Run the entire project's tests and verify that every one of them passes. If not review the related parts of the project and propose why previously passing tests are now failing. 7) Confirm with me that the problem is fixed, when I agree you can commit the change to github. In the final summary please list any added files and the full commit message. 
- Before every commit get my explicit permission before calling it. I will need to see the full commit message before it is called.
- Always present a plan and get permission before beginning to execute it for anything that requires changing any files.
- All this project needs to work within the isaaclab factory environment as they are defined here: https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/blob/main/source/isaaclab_tasks/isaaclab_tasks/direct/factory/factory_tasks_cfg.py, https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/blob/main/source/isaaclab_tasks/isaaclab_tasks/direct/factory/factory_env_cfg.py, and https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab/blob/main/source/isaaclab_tasks/isaaclab_tasks/direct/factory/factory_env.py 
- Our training pipeline inherts from this class in SKRL: https://github.com/Toni-SM/skrl/blob/main/skrl/agents/torch/ppo/ppo.py
- When reporting test results always provide number of passed, failed and total, there is no such thing as critical tests, they all must be passed.
- Do not place fallbacks in code. If the inputs are not what we expect throw an error and stop the program. Experiments take days so I need to know that what I think is happening is what is happening.
- When making unit tests, do not add code to the actual code to help unit testing. If a helper function is required define it in the unit test. It is important to keep the actual code clean and easy to read.
